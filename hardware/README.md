## Source of 3D printed parts

Most of the 3d printed parts are from [Michael Kubina's remix](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/tree/master/assembly) of the [original micro spot](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283). We used a [circular metal horn](https://www.amazon.com/Seamuing-Aluminum-Futaba-Mechanical-Helicopter/dp/B07D56FVK5/ref=sr_1_5?crid=2YJSU9SUXX5SR&keywords=servo+horn+metal&qid=1650157107&sprefix=servo+horn+metal%2Caps%2C230&sr=8-5) from amazon and used some of the mods from [Michael Kubina's repo](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32/tree/master/parts/SpotMicroESP32_parts_v1_0_0/mods/metaldisc_servohorn_mod).

We also used [robjk's reinforced shoulder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4937631) design as well as [makerrobotics' modification](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4968088) on the shoulder for circular servo horn.
